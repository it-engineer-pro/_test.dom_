SOME-QUIK-EDIT-TIPS in WorkRave.github

Often in setup, debug, install or deploy sessions, we need change content of config
quikly and in short delays. As is known Vim is the best choise in this routine, but not only.
Here is some tricks for reset content of the file without its recreation.

Simple echo usage:
# echo "" > access.log
# echo > access.log
# echo -n "" > access.log <<-- '-n' mean NO NEW LINE

OR:
# # truncate -s 0 access.log

OR:
vim access.log
Esc
:dG
:wq

vim access.log
Esc
:1,$d
:wq

Document Here (DocHere>):
cat > testlab.lan.zone
Ctrl+Shift+V
Ctrl+D

OR use cat > with-file-name.sh <<<''
cat > with-file-name.sh <<<'#!/bin/bash
#
#
ls -la
'

Additionally, you can empty the contents of a file
by redirecting the output of /dev/null to it (file)
as input using the cat command:
# cp access.log /root/backup/access.log
# cat /dev/null > access.log
OR:
# cp /dev/null access.log
# dd if=/dev/null of=access.log
# du -sh access.log <<-- check how much space it use.
